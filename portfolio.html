								<p> This is my first project that I have ever made.
									It is a game that
									allows users to catch falling friends in order to save them and get them points.
									There are enemies that
									fall, but if the user catches those then they lose points. This is a timed game and
									it allows the user
									to restart as many times as they want. Also, there is a happy melody that
									accompanies the game.</p>

								<p>I created this data structure handbook while I was learning all the different
									types of data structures. Since there were
									soo many data structures, I decided to develop a jupyter notebook so that I can
									reference it every time I forget about a
									certain data structure.

								<p> This is a website that I developed for our college's Association of Computing

									I was the first ever president of this club and we used this website to drive
									our purpose, which is to
									inspire and encourage diverse minds in Software Engineering/Computer Science.

								</header>
								<ul>
									<img src="/images/gallery/fulls/decide-app.jpeg" height="600" width="800">
								</ul>
								<p> Just a simple app that is similar to the magic eight-ball concept. You ask a
									question, and you get an answer back
									randomly. Great starter project for learning Angular.

									<img src="/images/gallery/fulls/hr-onboarding.jpeg" height="600" width="800">
								</ul>
								<p> A single page application made with Angular and TypeScript and styled with
									Tailwind Css that centralizes all onboarding
									tasks. This is still an ongoing project and plan on adding the following
									features:

									- add API communication with 3rd party tasks like Trello and Jira
									- Add UI/UX for when a task is complete
									- Collect task statuses in the background to generate a report
									- Generate PDF Report and email functionality

								</ul>
								<p> The app's primary goal is to help law enforcement find victims of sex
									trafficking through empowering volunteers
									nationwide. Registered and trained volunteers are given a platform to submit
									publicly traceable information on potential
									leads. Once a report is complete, this information will be packaged as a PDF and
									sent off to a 3rd party to undergo a
									validation process, where verified investigations will then be forwarded to law
									enforcement.

								<ul>
									<img src="/images/gallery/fulls/access2.jpeg" height="600" width="800">
								</ul>
								<p> This is the original version of access that enables editors who utilize Premiere
									Pro in their QA Process of their media supply chain <a
										href="https://sdvi.com/platform/">(Rally)</a>
									In other words, it leverages the functionality of Rally to help support qa
									processes in an organizations media supply chain.
									I was able to contribute to this project by resolving business logic bugs as
									well as UI bugs.

								<ul>
									<img src="/images/gallery/fulls/access3.jpeg" height="600" width="800">
								</ul>
								<p> This is the next iteration of Access2 which has been completely rebuilt in Vue3
									from Angular. The use case is the same as Access2
									but it also has some added features that help make the QA Process for
									organizations media supply chains more efficient. In this iteration of Access,
									I was able to actually create features. The major features that I added to this
									project include a bootloader and the authentication process.
									With the bootloader, it allows users to grab a version of the application based
									off a deployment manifest on a cdn. The authentication feature that I added
									uses the Oauth 2.0 standard. This authentication process includes the ability to
									grab a new authentication token when it expires and when a refresh token expires
									I created a whole workflow prompts the user re-authenticate. When they successfully
									authenticate, they will be able to resume their session with a new authentication
									and refresh token.

									<h2><a href="https://main.ddpeo76hktjve.amplifyapp.com">Open Doors Sanctuary
										</a></h2>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<img src="/images/gallery/fulls/open-doors-sanctuary.jpeg" height="600" width="800">
								</ul>
								<p> An Open Source Project with the idea to create a web app (desktop and
									mobile) that will allow fleeing Ukrainians to find a safe haven. It will be similar
									to Airbnb but instead of charging Ukrainians, it helps to link them to housing from
									a volunteer family who is willing to take them in. This could be from nato countries
									or far away from where the fighting is actually happening. The volunteer family
									would create an account and list the amenities that the fleeing Ukrainians will have
									access to. The Ukrainians will then be able to create an account and view all the
									possible safe havens that are available and they sign up for how many days that is
									needed.

									<h2><a href="https://d3urubd6wwveok.cloudfront.net/">Connect 4 Vets</a></h2>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<img src="/images/gallery/fulls/connect-4-vets.jpeg" height="600" width="800">
								</ul>
								<p> A community sponsorship application aimed at fighting the homeless crisis by
									outsourcing sponsors out in the local community to help homeless veterans in-process
									with the VA. This app's primary goal is to in-process homeless veterans through the
									VA so they can get adequate health care, housing, and employment opportunities.
									However, the main struggle is that the Veteran doesn't have access to technologies
									or the basic tools to in-process themselves. That's where this application comes in
									for the rescue. This application targets a Sponsor as the main user and they can
									sponsor up to 4 veterans at a time, hence the name 'Connect 4 Vets'. Our team
									ultimately decided on this number because it seemed that any other number greater
									than 4 would feel too much for a sponsor to take on. We believe that the sponsor
									should avoid burnout by not taking too much on their plate. What this allows for is
									that the sponsor can show up for the veteran at 100% at most times, therefore,
									allowing the veteran to get the quality experience they signed up for.
